A basic flight booking tool using JS ES6 classes

https://u-kaushik.github.io/OOPFlightBooker/

A simple project to practice object orientated programming in Javascript.
First written using prototypes and then refactored to using classes.

Areas for improvement
1. Use of React
2. Use of ternary operators for conditional alerts
3. Use of a CSS framework
4. Use of sign up/ login functionality
5. Use of database storage
